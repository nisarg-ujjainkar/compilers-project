C is an imperative programming language. It was developed by Dennis 
Ritchie in 1972~\cite{C}. C is still widely used by programmers through out the 
world. Its object-oriented programming features inspired and lead to 
the development of languages such as C++ and Python. C programs have an 
elegant grammar. Hence, building a compiler for C will be useful in 
learning basic techniques and functionalities of compilers. Another 
advantage with choosing C is that it is closer to the architecture
of the system, which we believe would provide us lot of opportunities
to optimise the compiler that we build.
