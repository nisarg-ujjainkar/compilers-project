We plan to code our compiler using C. This means that our compiler 
could be compiled by itself. Also, we plan to use Flex for generating 
lexical analyzers and Bison for generating parsers. We would use the QEMU~\cite{Qemu}
emulator to test our compiler. We plan to include the following functionalities in our compiler: loops, conditional statement, functions, recursion support, and logic programming.
